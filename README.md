# Spotify Music Clique Project
A place for friends to share music that they're listening to, so long as they're listening to that music on Spotify.

## Name ideas:
..* SuperAwesome
..* Echo Chamber

## Milestones:
1. built a pretty front-end.
2. built out some functionality for gathering relevant information from Spotify and writing it to a JSON file.

## Todo:
Lots. Probably the next step is to get the front and back ends talking to one another.
